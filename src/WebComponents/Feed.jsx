            Dal bhat, a simple dish of lentils (dal) and rice (bhat) is Nepalâ€™s
            national dish. While the dal and rice are simple elements, they are
            usually accompanied by tarkari (vegetable curry), achaar (pickled
            vegetables), sag (fired greens such as spinach) and a papad or two.
            A few years ago, my wife and I went on a two-week trek in the Nepali
            part of Himalaya and dal bhat was one of our favourite dishes we
            would order at the teahouses along the popular route up to Everest
            base camp. This veritable feast is great for adding fuel back after
            a long day of walking.

            cell structure and boosts the health of skin, hair and nails. It
            also plays a crucial role in weight loss. Turns out, eating more

            hard to understand how your satiety levels are linked with weight
            management. If you feel full, you would not be tempted to nibble
            into anything fattening that comes your way, thus minimising chances
            of weight gain.
